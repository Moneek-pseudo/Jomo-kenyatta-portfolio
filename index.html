                <li>Born in 1897 in Gatundu, in what is now Kiambu County, Kenya.</li>
                <li>
                    His birth name was Kamau wa Ngengi; he later adopted the name Jomo
                    Kenyatta ("burning spear").
                </li>
                <li>
                    Grew up in a Kikuyu farming community, immersed in local traditions
                    and oral histories.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a youth, he was exposed to Christian missionary teachings and

                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Education</h3>

                <li>
                    Attended Church of Scotland mission school at Thogoto, where he
                    trained as a carpenter and learned English..
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the 1920s, he moved to London, where he became involved in
                    pan-African politics and pursued further studies.
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    Authored Facing Mount Kenya (1938), a seminal anthropological work
                    that defended Kikuyu culture and challenged colonial narratives.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Political journey</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Involved with the East African Association and later the Kenya
                    African Union (KAU), pushing for African rights and land reforms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Became a key symbol of resistance during the Mau Mau Uprising
                    (1952–1960), though he denied involvement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    BArrested in 1952 by British authorities and sentenced to prison for
                    alleged Mau Mau involvement; served nearly 9 years in detention
                </li>
                <li>
                    Upon release in 1961, he became the face of Kenya’s independence
                    movement and was widely seen as the rightful leader.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Presidency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Became Prime Minister in 1963, when Kenya gained internal
                    self-governance
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1964, Kenya became a republic, and Kenyatta became its first
                    President.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Led the country through its post-independence transition, promoting
                    national unity under the slogan "Harambee" (meaning "pulling
                    together").
                </li>
                <li>
                    His leadership emphasized capitalist development, foreign
                    investment, and land redistribution—though critics argue it also led
                    to inequality and ethnic favoritism.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Served as President until his death in 1978, overseeing a relatively
                    stable but centralized government.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Legacy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Widely regarded as the Father of the Nation, with cities, roads, and
                    institutions named in his honor (e.g., Jomo Kenyatta International
                    Airport).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remembered for both nation-building and controversy—praised for
                    unity, but critiqued for authoritarian tendencies and land
                    concentration issues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    His family, including his son Uhuru Kenyatta, has remained
                    influential in Kenyan politics.

        <p>
            Jomo Kenyatta’s contributions span political activism, diplomacy, and
            cultural defense. Here’s a deeper dive into his key areas of work:
        </p>
        <div>
            <h3>Anti-Colonial Activism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vocal advocate for African land rights and self-rule.</li>
                <li>
                    Mobilized local and international attention through writings and
                    speeches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Worked closely with pan-African leaders like Kwame Nkrumah and
                    W.E.B. Du Bois.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Mau Mau Symbolism</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Though not directly linked to Mau Mau operational leadership, he was
                    portrayed by colonial powers as its ideological head.
                </li>
                <li>
                    His arrest galvanized international sympathy and fueled the push for
                    independence.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Negotiations for Independence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Played a leading role in Lancaster House Conferences (1960s),
                    negotiating Kenya’s path to independence.li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Became a unifying figure across ethnic and political divisions in
                    the run-up to independence.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Nation-Building Policies</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Promoted Harambee, encouraging community self-help initiatives to
                    build schools, hospitals, and infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Emphasized national identity over tribalism, though some policies
                    favored Kikuyu elites.li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Supported agricultural reforms and development, but land
                    redistribution was uneven.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Cultural Preservation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Through Facing Mount Kenya, defended African traditions and
                    indigenous governance systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Advocated for the recognition of African heritage in post-colonial
                    governance and education.
                </li>
